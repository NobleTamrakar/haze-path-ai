    "question": "A ball is thrown vertically upward with a velocity of 20 m/s. What is the maximum height reached?",
    "options": ["10 m", "15 m", "20 m", "25 m"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Using v² = u² + 2as, where final velocity v = 0, initial velocity u = 20 m/s, acceleration a = -9.8 m/s². Height = u²/2g = 400/19.6 ≈ 20 m"

    "options": ["Law of inertia", "Law of acceleration", "Law of action-reaction", "Law of gravitation"],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Newton's first law states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force. This is the law of inertia."

    "options": ["Conservation of energy", "Conservation of momentum", "Conservation of mass", "Conservation of charge"],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another - this is conservation of energy."

    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "In DNA, Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) through hydrogen bonding. Guanine pairs with Cytosine."
